# Contributing Guide
## Introduction
Thank you for contributing to the Automatic Ripping Machine.

## Issues, Bugs, and Feature Requests
If you find a bug, please paste the relevant logfile in /opt/arm/logs/
Also, since ARM relies on software such a HandBrake and MakeMKV try running those programs manually to see if it's an issue there.

When submitting a bug, enhancement, or feature request please indicate if you are able/willing to make the changes yourself in a pull request.

## Pull Requests
To make a pull request fork this project into your own github repository and after making changes create a PR.  Read https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/

Test your changes locally to the best of your ability to make sure nothing broke.

If you are making multiple changes, please create  separate pull requests so they can be evaluated and approved individually (obviously if changes are trivial, or multiple changes are dependent on each other then one PR is fine).

Update the README file in your PR if your changes require them.

After submitting your PR check that the Travis CI build passes, if it doesn't you can fix those issues with additional commits.

## Testing, Quality, etc.
If you are interested in helping out with testing, quality, etc. please let me know.
